# Bool

## Define Bool
to define boolean variable

```engine
bool variable = True
bool variable_1 = False
bool variable_2 = False || True
bool variable_3 = False && True
bool variable_4 = 5 + 4 > 3 + 7 && 5 % 2 == 1
```

# Int

## Define Int
to define Integer variable

```engine
int variable_0 = 5
int variable_1 = 6 + 5 - 7 * 7 / 2 + (
    5 - variable_0 * ( 6 % 2 )
)

variable_1 += 5
variable_1 -= 5
variable_1 *= 5
variable_1 /= 5
variable_1 %= 5
```

# Double

## Define Double
to define Double variable

```engine
double variable = 6.2 + 8
double variable_2 = 0.1 - 0.4
```

# Char

## Define Char
to define Character variable

```engine
char variable = 'H'
char variable_1 = "h"
```

# String

## Define String
to define String variable

```engine
string variable = "Hello World"
string variable_1 = 'Hello world!!'
string variable_2 = "Hello" + " World" + ',' + ' Dude!!!'
```


# Define variable without writing the type
you can define variable without writing the variable type like that.

```engine
var new_variable = True
```
or directly
```
new_variable = True
```

the language will try to infer the type of the variable then define new variable
based on the infered type, so the new varialbe will be of type boolean.


take a special note that if you define character like this
```engine
new_variable = 'H'
```
the language will consider it as string.


# Some Notes
New line is the line terminator for the statement (like simicolon in c and c++)
