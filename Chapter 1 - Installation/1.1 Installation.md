# Requirements:

1. Your OS is ubuntu.
2. Rust programming language is installed on your OS, as Engine language is based on rust.


# Installation
The language has two Repos
1. Interpreter
2. Compiler















## Install The Compiler
To install the compiler
```bash
git clone https://github.com/engine-lang/compiler.git
```


## Compile The Compiler
```bash
cd compiler && cargo build --release
cd target/release
```
you will find the compiler called `enginec`


## Compiler Modes
The compiler has two modes
1. Compile the code into executable
2. Compile the code into byte code


### Compile File into executable
create file called `hello-world.en`
```bash
touch hello-world.en
```

open file and write this code
```
string variable_1 = "hello"
print(variable_1)

string variable_2 = ", world!!!!"
print(variable_2)
```

```bash
enginec "hello-world.en"
```

it will generate file called `hello-world`

to run it type
```bash
./hello-world
```
it should print something like that
```
hello, world!!!!
```


### Compile File into Byte Code
create file called `hello-world.en`
```bash
touch hello-world.en
```

open file and write this code
```
string variable_1 = "hello"
print(variable_1)

string variable_2 = ", world!!!!"
print(variable_2)
```


```bash
enginec "hello-world.en" --byte-code
```

it will generate file called `hello-world.en.byte`

it should look like this
```engine.byte
0:EngineByteCode:v0.1.0
1:Assign:string:"temp_1":"hello"
2:Assign:string:"variable_variable_1":""
3:Convert:string:"variable_variable_1":"temp_1"
4:Print:"variable_variable_1"
5:Assign:string:"temp_2":", world!!!!"
6:Assign:string:"variable_variable_2":""
7:Convert:string:"variable_variable_2":"temp_2"
8:Print:"variable_variable_2"
9:End:
```

you can then use it to your specific cases, or you can run it using the interpreter.
















## Install The Interpreter
To install the interpreter
```bash
git clone https://github.com/engine-lang/interpreter.git
```

## Compile The Interpreter
```bash
cd interpreter && cargo build --release
cd target/release
```
you will find the interpreter called `enginei`

## Interpreter Modes
The interpreter has three modes
1. Interactive shell to run code on shell
2. Interpreter for the file
3. Intepreter for byte code


### Run Interacrive shell
```bash
enginei
```
it will open Interactive shell


### Interprete File
create file called `hello-world.en`
```bash
touch hello-world.en
```

open file and write this code
```
string variable_1 = "hello"
print(variable_1)

string variable_2 = ", world!!!!"
print(variable_2)
```

```bash
enginei "hello-world.en"
```

### Interprete Byte Code

to run byte code

```bash
enginei "hello-world.en.byte" --byte-code
```
