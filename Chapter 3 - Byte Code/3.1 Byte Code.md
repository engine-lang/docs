# Instroduction
This is the byte code instructions that will be generated if you want to compile the code into byte code.

# `EngineByteCode` Instruction
This is the first instruction in the file

`LINE:EngineByteCode:v0.1.0`

`LINE`            =>  is the current instruction line, it will always be `0`

`EngineByteCode`  =>  Instruction Type

`v0.1.0`          =>  Current version


# `Assign` Instruction
This instruction is used to create new variable then assign it with value.

## Instruction Construction
`LINE:Assign:VariableType:"VariableName":VariableValue`

`LINE`            =>  is the current instruction line

`Assign`          =>  is the instruction Type

`VariableType`    =>  is the Variable type for ex: (bool, int, double, character, string)

`"VariableName"`  =>  Variable Name with double quotes

`VariableValue`   =>  The value for the variable for ex: (True, False, 5, 'H', "Hello")

for ex:

    5:Assign:bool:"variable_1":True
    6:Assign:bool:"variable_2":False
    7:Assign:int:"variable_3":5
    8:Assign:double:"variable_4":5.2
    9:Assign:char:"variable_5":'H'
    10:Assign:string:"variable_6":"Hello, World!"


# `Convert` Instruction
This instruction is used to convert the value from type to another.

## Instruction Construction
`LINE:Convert:ConvertToType:"AsssignToVariableName":"FromVariableName"`


`LINE`                        =>  is the current instruction line

`Convert`                     =>  Instruction Type

`ConvertToType`               =>  This is the convert to type for ex: (bool, int, double, character, string)

`"AsssignToVariableName"`     =>  Variable name which the converted value will be put in it.

`"FromVariableName"`          =>  Variable name which will have the value which needs to be converted.


for ex:

    5:Convert:bool:"Variable2":"Variable1"
    6:Convert:double:"Variable3":"Variable4"
    7:Convert:char:"Variable5":"Variable6"


# `Operation` Instruction
This is the operations instruction

## Instruction Construction
`LINE:Operation:OperationType:"AssignToVariableName":"LeftVariableName":"RightVariableName"`


`LINE`                        =>  is the current instruction line

`Operation`                   =>  Instruction Type

`OperationType`               =>  Operation Type (
                                    Plus, Minus, Mul, Div, Mod,
                                    And, Or,
                                    GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqual, LessThan, LessThanOrEqual,
                                    Equal, NotEqual)

`"AssignToVariableName"`      =>  the variable name which the final value will be assigned to it.

`"LeftVariableName"`          =>  the first variable

`"RightVariableName"`         =>  the second variable


for ex:

    6:Operation:Plus:"Variable3":"Variable2":"Variable1"
    7:Operation:And:"Variable5":"Variable4":"Variable3"


# `Print` Instruction
This is the print instruction

## Instruction Construction
`LINE:Print:"VariableName"`


`LINE`             =>  is the current instruction line

`Print`            =>  Instruction Type

`"VariableName"`   =>  The variable name to print


for ex:

    5:Print:"Variable"


# `End` Instruction
This is the end of byte code instruction


## Instruction Construction
`LINE:End:`

`LINE`     =>  is the current instruction line

`End`      =>  Instruction Type

For ex:

    130:End:
